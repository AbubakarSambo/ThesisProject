# ThesisProject
Development of Android based circuit simulator
This project came about as a result of the need for non-traditional means of doing circuit analysis which involve laptops/desktops.
This project achieves this by allowing the user design a circuit schematic on the canvas and choose the required analysis.The front-end
generates a Netlist and passes it to the back end which parses the message and determines the analysis the user wants. The back end then 
does all the calculations and returns the required plots on the canvas.
